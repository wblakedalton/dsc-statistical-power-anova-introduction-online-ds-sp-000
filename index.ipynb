    "In this section you'll continue to deepen your knowledge of hypothesis testing and t-tests by examining the concept of power; an idea closely related to type II errors. With that, you'll see how the rate of type I errors, power, sample size, and effect size are intrinsically related to one another. You will then move on to ANOVA - Analysis of Variance, which allows you to test for the influence of multiple factors all at once."

    "## Statistical power\n",
    "\n",
    "Statistical power is equal to $1 - \\beta$ where $\\beta$ is the rate of type II errors. As you will see, power is related to $\\alpha$, sample size, and effect size. Typically a researcher will select an acceptable alpha value and then examine required sample sizes to achieve the desired power such as 0.8 (or higher). \n",

    "## Welch's t-test\n",
    "\n",
    "After an initial exploration of statistical power, you'll take a look at Welch's t-test. This is an adaptation of the unpaired student's t-test you've seen previously which allows for different sample sizes or different variances between the two groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Multiple comparisons\n",
    "\n",
    "From there, you'll look at some of the issues that arise when trying to perform multiple comparisons - from the risks of spurious correlations to the importance of corrections such as the Bonferroni correction to deal with the cumulative risks of type I errors inherent in multiple comparisons.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## ANOVA\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, you'll take a look at the more generalized procedure for conducting multiple comparisons: Analysis of Variance or ANOVA. You'll see that ANOVA of only two groups is statistically equivalent to a two sided t-test. That said, ANOVA fully supports comparing multiple factors simultaneously."
